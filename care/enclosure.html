    <h2>Why Does Space Matter?</h2>
    <p>The minimum for all hamsters in unbroken floorspace is 100x50 cm, and it's the ethical minium. You don't want anything less than that, it is not an "ideal minimum" or anything, it is the minimum and you should go higher than the minimum <i>if possible</i>.</p>
    <p>Hamsters are naturally already very active animals and explorers, so because of that hamsters do need enough space to roam around a bit and also have enough space for their necessities.</p>
    <p>
      For example, in small cages that are sold the most which have only about <span style="font-weight: 500;">700 cm<sup>2</sup></span>, you just can't fit their necessities, like a large enough wheel <span style="font-weight: 500;">(20-28cm)</span>, a <span style="font-weight: 500;">sand bath</span> and also enough bedding to properly burrow. 
    </p>
    <p>
      And also, hamsters run approximately 8 km per night, so they can't be crammed into a small little room where their toilet and eating area are within 2 steps.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 500;">Example of a good hamster enclosure:</p>

    <h2>Choosing The Right Cage</h2>
    <p>Choosing the right cage is often crucial, as mostly you just can't walk into a pet store and get one there and also hamsters have to have uninterrupted floor space, so no tube-connecting to reach the needed floorspace.<br>Uninterrupted floorspace allows for them to move freely, burrow as much as they want and do not restrict their movement. Tubes may also be too small, so they can either get stuck in there or if they move with their full cheecks, then them also can get the hamster stuck in the tubes.</p>
    <h2>Great cages sold in <a href="https://amazon.de" style="font-size: 1.3rem;">Amazon.de</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h2>1. Bucatstate</h2></li>
      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.de/s?srs=52053917031&rh=p_89%3ABUCATSTATE" target="_blank">BUCATSTATE</a> has different cage sizes and colors, which are basically metal and aluminium frames and bases holding up good quality acrylic sheets, which are also totally escape-proof.</p>
      <p>
        They got different versions of their cages like 2.0 and 3.0, the 2.0 only has 100x50 cm and 80x44,7 cm cages while the 3.0 has got better durability and quality with cage sizes such as 100x50 cm and 120x60 cm but also pricier than the 2.0.
      </p>
      <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716a-CMVQ+L._AC_SX425_.jpg" style="padding: 2rem;">
      <li><h2>2. Niteangel</h2></li>
      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.de/stores/NiteangelPet/page/55765D03-86DD-428C-BB22-69B98CFC830D?lp_asin=B09CCLRJN8&ref_=ast_bln&store_ref=bl_ast_dp_brandLogo_sto" target="_blank">NITEANGEL</a> Has also got different cage options, and I'd say even more than Bucatstate, they got different metal and wooden options, although the prices are not cheap.</p>
      <p>
        Although the quality is certainly good, most people will rather buy a Bucatstate, because most people just don't want to pay that much for a cage. For example, the 100x50 cm Bucatstate cage is 187€ currently, but the 103.4x57.7 cm wooden cage, which's inside measurements are rather near 100x50, is 324€, a pretty big difference.

            <li><h2>3. Savic Plaza</h2></li>
      <p><a href="https://www.amazon.de/s?srs=18306351031&rh=p_89%3ASavic" target="_blank">SAVIC</a> Has a cage like <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Savic-20547-Kleintierheim-Hamster-Plaza/dp/B071RNWH11/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&crid=21E62NRPB38T1&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.zCO0l-MJim99E7DKmWUsGJ4ouqv06s0u6cjYnl4apj-VTMU3Mibq71xO6fFC50c73FN-8TkYHNgKcdmT8k8LzOrqLLsvKabUJ5tE2eN5FezEN4sdPZjoYfGiYBZdt59wqdQJzkiuP8P8qsy925a28ha-I6V_B-XFlQQXARBAmZN-5FMwY3ohv87-8OwicbagoaTi63azCASjdkSU5syfDYgWepps3hQIvJa9LvDjH6MQ6FrVw8sP-lIwbVttDP4M-Yt1VsWilmPvLk5F2xx8B0EWkaeP4OG1ULR0LRjc-FA.84N5-1IT-RGDqCD7so0rkEhNWmn_07h6sJ_ervOSDvw&dib_tag=se&keywords=savic+plaza&qid=1756657598&sprefix=savic+plaza%2Caps%2C100&sr=8-1" style="font-size: small;">Hamster Plaza </a>100x50x50 cm but it has its critiques. First of all, the main thing that matters is floorspace. But when you would measure the base of the Savic Hamster Plaza, it's closer to only 4000 cm<sup>2</sup> than 5000 cm<sup>2</sup>, because yes, the outside measurements may be close to 100x50 cm, but the usable floorspace is way less than advertised.</p>
      <p>
        While yes, it's under the minimum for dwarves, 100x50x40 cm, it can be used for when the hamster is young or just temporarily, not full time. You cannot put enough bedding in it without overflowing, and yes, you can technically put acrylic sheets or something else to catch the bedding, it's still not worth it to buy and use full time. The hamster can chew or gnaw on the bars and also climb on them, and then fall and because hamsters are not climbers, they can be in pain. And even if you want to say otherwise how it could work, at this point just buy a Bucatstate or a Niteangel cage, they're prettier, bigger and better to use.

    <h2>DIY Cages</h2>
    <p>Because the cages you see in Amazon and other online stores are usually very expensive, sometimes you'd be able to buy a big enough plastic bin and then make a cage from there, but you also need to make sure that at the base of the final cage is at least 100x50 cm.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><h2>1 Bin</h2></li>
      <p>If you happen to find a bin that is at least 100x50 cm on the base of the bin and is also transparent from at least the front, then you can watch this tutorial of someone creating one, but be mindful that the video is a bit outdated and the "450 in<sup>2</sup> minimum" is now 775 in<sup>2</sup>.</p>
      <iframe width="100%" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i5e-2yKLX2Q" title="HOW TO MAKE A BIN CAGE | DIY Hamster cage!" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <li><h2>2 Bins</h2></li>
      <p>Because most countries do not offer cages with enough floorspace in a single bin, then another great option is connecting 2 separate bins by cutting their sides off and then from there connecting them with either some kind of glue or other pieces.</p>
      <p>Here is a great tutorial on connecting 2 separate bins, but the person in the video has their own measurements calculated so try seeing what size parts fit the best for your cage.</p>

      <li><h2>DIY Ikea Cage</h2></li>
      <p>Also another great option besides bin cages are DIY Ikea cages made from cabinets or similar things by mainly just creating a great lid on top to make it escape proof.</p>
      <p>Here is another great tutorial making the cage with Ikea Linnmon</p>
